# Deep-Fake Voice Detection

This project combats the threat of deep-fake voices by developing effective detection methods. 
We compare Recursive Neural Networks (RNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The RNN method, using FFTs and Mel Frequency Coefficients, achieved 57% accuracy. 
In contrast, the CNN method, utilizing spectrograms, achieved 95% accuracy. 
By leveraging CNNs and spectrograms, this approach provides a promising solution for detecting deep-fake voices and mitigating misinformation.
